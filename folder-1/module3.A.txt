Introduction to FileSystem :
--------------------------------- >

# What is a FileSystem ?
    .> It is an system used by an operating system to manage files. The system controls how data is saved or retrieved.
    .> OS stores files and directories in an organized and structured way.
    .>  There are many different types if the file systems
      eg:    ext3, ext4, xfs, NTFS, FAT etc.


File system Structure and its Description :
-------------------------------------------------- >

/boot  : Contains file that is used by the boot loader (grub.cfg)
  .> When your os is booting , then the info in this file will be booted first.
/root : root user home directory. It is a not same as /
/dev: System devices (disk, cdrom, speakers, flashdrive, keyboards etc.)
/etc : Configuration files
/bin ..> /usr/bin : Everyday user commands
/sbin ..>/usr/sbin : System/filesSystem commands.
/opt  : Optional add-on application (Not part of OS apps)
/proc : Running process ( only exist in Memory )
/lib : C programmming library files needed by commands and apps.
/temp : Directory for temporary files.
/home : Directory for user  [give us details of the all the users inside the system]
/var : System logs 
 > In the above directory the system logs will be stored.
/run : System daemons that start very early (e.g systemd and udev )to store temporary runtime files like PID files.
/ mnt : To mount external filesystem (e.g NFS)
/ media : For cdrom mounts. 


the linux kernel will create all these file 


File Navigation System Commands :
--------------------------------------- >

.> In order to move  from normal user to he root user we need to use the command called 
   $: su -
   $: password : { enter the password here to become the root user }


.>  after entering the ls -l

-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  ...... { if any starts with the '-' then it is said tobe  file }
drwxr-xr-x. 33 root root ...... { if any thing starts with the d then it is said to be directory /folder}

Note : when any things starts with the "d" { then it is said to be and directory or folder}


Linux File or Directory Properties:
------------------------------------------ >

.> Each file or directory in linux has details information or properties.
When we use the ls -l, then we get the 

Type/Perms   Links   Owner    Group    Size   Month  Day   Time     Name
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
drw-r--r--   1       sachin   staff    2048   Feb    7     10:30    notes.txt
drwxr-xr-x   2       sachin   staff    4096   Feb    6     18:20    projects
-rwxr-xr-x   1       sachin   staff    1024   Feb    5     09:15    script.sh



here :  drw-r--r--  [ start with the "d", then it is directory/folder]
        lrwxr-xr-x  [ starts with the "l", then it is link to the other file]
        -rwxr-xr-x  [ starts with the "-", then it is file ]

Note : The second column is the number of hard links to the file,For a directory ,the number of hard links is the number of immediate subdirectories it has plus its parent directory and itself.


File System Paths:
--------------------- >
Absolute and relative paths

.> There are two paths to navigate to a filesystem
  # Absolute Paths
  # Relative paths


# An absolute path always begins with a "/".This indicates that the path starts at the root directory.
.> an example of an absolute path is cd/var/log/samba

# An relative path does not bogin with a "/". It identifies a location relative to your current position. An example of a relative path is  
  cd /var
  cd log
  cd samba


Creating File and Directories :
-------------------------------------- >
 # Creating Files And Directories:

* Creating Files:
touch
cp
vi


EX1: touch file_name
EX2: cp current_file_name destination_file_name
EX3: vi file_name
shift:wq! + "enter"


EX4: touch file_name_1 fila_name_2 file_name_3 
So, by using this we can create has many has file names.

* Creating Directories:
mkdir


ex1: mkdir directory_name 

EX2: mkdir directory_name1 directory_name2 directory_name3
The above command will make the 3 directories.


Copying Directories:
------------------------ >
# Command to copy a directory:
 > cp

# To copy a directory on Linux, you have tp execute the "cp" command with the '-R' option for recursive and specify the source and destination directories to be copied.

ex: cp -R <source_folder> <destination_folder>


Finding Files and Directories (find, locate) :
-------------------------------------------------- >
* Two main directories 

Syntax: find [name for the file which we are searching]
 
>  we can give the relative path here by using the '.'
ex: find . -name "kramer"

locate [ name of the file which we want to search ]


Note : if the locate command does not output any result, then as root run "updatedb"

Also make sure you have "mlocate" package installed
To check =rpm -qa | grep mlocate
To install =yum install mlocate

Difference Between find and locate :
--------------------------------------- >


locate : uses a prebuild database, which is should be regularly updated, while find iterates over a filesystem to locate files. Thus, locate is much faster that find, but can be inaccurate if the database ( can be seen as a cache) is not updated.

> To update locate database run updatedb



Wildcards in linux :
----------------------- >
> A wildcard is a character that can be used as a substitute for any of a class of character in a search.
  * ..> represents zero or more characters 
  ? ..> represents a single character
  [] ..> represents a range of characters


ex: rm : Remove, This command is used to remove the files
rm abc* { This will remove all the files which are start with the abc..}

EX: creation of the 10 files:
touch abcd{1..9}-xyz
ls -l abc*
rm  


Linux File Types:
------------------------------- >
* There are different types of teh files, Regular file,
Directory, Link, Special file or device file, socket, Named pipe, Block Device.

File_symbol   Meaning
-             Regilar file
d             directory
l             link
c             Special file or device file
s             socket
p             Named pipe
b             block  Device


Block device File: [ b ]
------------------------ >
* Hard drives
* USB drives
Startin

1) - Regular File
Used for: Storing normal data like text, code, images, executables.
Example: notes.txt → A normal text file containing meeting notes.

2) d Directory
Used for: Holding files and other directories (like a folder).
Example: projects/ → A folder that contains multiple project files.

3) l Symbolic Link (Soft Link)
Used for: A shortcut that points to another file or directory.
Example: config_link -> /etc/config → A shortcut to another file.

4) c Character Device File 
Used for: Devices that transfer data one character at a time (stream-based).
Example: /dev/tty → Represents your terminal device.


5) s Socket
Used for: Communication between processes (IPC – Inter Process Communication).
Example: /var/run/docker.sock → Used by Docker to communicate internally.

6) p Named Pipe (FIFO) :
Used for: Passing data from one process to another (like a one-way channel).
Example: mkfifo mypipe → Creates a pipe to send data between programs.

7) b Block Device File 
Used for: Devices that transfer data in blocks (like hard disks).
Example: /dev/sda → Represents your hard disk.



Soft And Hard Link:
------------------------- >
inode = Pointer or number of a file on the hard disk.

An inode will store the File Permission
Owner, Size, Timestamps, Disk block locations.
> File name is stored in the directory.
> The directory maps filename >> inode number.

command: ls -li notes.txt
ex: 123456 -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 200 Feb 8 notes.txt
123456 = inode number.

NOTE : The inode does not store the file name

Directory
   |
   |---- file1.txt  ----\
   |                     >  inode 12345  ---> actual data blocks on disk
   |---- file2.txt  ----/
Both names point to the SAME inode.

When we delete one:
rm file1.txt 
The file still exits because inode still has i link.
The file will be removed only when  Link count becomes 0.


Note : every time when we create an file, an number called will assigned to that file on the hard disk.


# Soft Link : This link will be created when an file is created and Link will be removed if file is removed or renamed.

SOFT LINK (Symbolic Link)
> A soft link is a special file that stores the path of another file.
> If original file moves or deletes  .> link breaks.

# Hard Link : Deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the hard link.


| Feature          | Hard Link         | Soft Link         |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Inode            | Same inode        | Different inode   |
| Disk Space       | No extra data     | Small extra space |
| Link count       | Increases         | No change         |
| Delete original  | File still exists | Link breaks       |
| Cross filesystem | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes             |
| Link directories | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes             |
| Type in `ls -l`  | `-`               | `l`               |
