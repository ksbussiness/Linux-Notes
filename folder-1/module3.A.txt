Introduction to FileSystem :
--------------------------------- >

# What is a FileSystem ?
    .> It is an system used by an operating system to manage files. The system controls how data is saved or retrieved.
    .> OS stores files and directories in an organized and structured way.
    .>  There are many different types if the file systems
      eg:    ext3, ext4, xfs, NTFS, FAT etc.


File system Structure and its Description :
-------------------------------------------------- >

/boot  : Contains file that is used by the boot loader (grub.cfg)
  .> When your os is booting , then the info in this file will be booted first.
/root : root user home directory. It is a not same as /
/dev: System devices (disk, cdrom, speakers, flashdrive, keyboards etc.)
/etc : Configuration files
/bin ..> /usr/bin : Everyday user commands
/sbin ..>/usr/sbin : System/filesSystem commands.
/opt  : Optional add-on application (Not part of OS apps)
/proc : Running process ( only exist in Memory )
/lib : C programmming library files needed by commands and apps.
/temp : Directory for temporary files.
/home : Directory for user  [give us details of the all the users inside the system]
/var : System logs 
 > In the above directory the system logs will be stored.
/run : System daemons that start very early (e.g systemd and udev )to store temporary runtime files like PID files.
/ mnt : To mount external filesystem (e.g NFS)
/ media : For cdrom mounts. 


the linux kernel will create all these file 


File Navigation System Commands :
--------------------------------------- >

.> In order to move  from normal user to he root user we need to use the command called 
   $: su -
   $: password : { enter the password here to become the root user }


.>  after entering the ls -l

-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  ...... { if any starts with the '-' then it is said tobe  file }
drwxr-xr-x. 33 root root ...... { if any thing starts with the d then it is said to be directory /folder}

Note : when any things starts with the "d" { then it is said to be and directory or folder}


Linux File or Directory Properties:
------------------------------------------ >

.> Each file or directory in linux has details information or properties.
When we use the ls -l, then we get the 

Type/Perms   Links   Owner    Group    Size   Month  Day   Time     Name
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
drw-r--r--   1       sachin   staff    2048   Feb    7     10:30    notes.txt
drwxr-xr-x   2       sachin   staff    4096   Feb    6     18:20    projects
-rwxr-xr-x   1       sachin   staff    1024   Feb    5     09:15    script.sh



here :  drw-r--r--  [ start with the "d", then it is directory/folder]
        lrwxr-xr-x  [ starts with the "l", then it is link to the other file]
        -rwxr-xr-x  [ starts with the "-", then it is file ]

Note : The second column is the number of hard links to the file,For a directory ,the number of hard links is the number of immediate subdirectories it has plus its parent directory and itself.


File System Paths:
--------------------- >
Absolute and relative paths

.> There are two paths to navigate to a filesystem
  # Absolute Paths
  # Relative paths


# An absolute path always begins with a "/".This indicates that the path starts at the root directory.
.> an example of an absolute path is cd/var/log/samba

# An relative path does not bogin with a "/". It identifies a location relative to your current position. An example of a relative path is  
  cd /var
  cd log
  cd samba
