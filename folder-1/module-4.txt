Linux Command Syntax:
------------------------------ >

Commands typically have the syntax:
  > command options arguments


File and Directory Permissions ( chmod ) :
----------------------------------------------- >
> Permissions for an file or directory may be restricted to by types
> There are 3 types of the Permissions
  * r - read 
  * w - write 
  * x - execute = running a program

> Each permission (rwx) can be controlled at three levels
  * u - user = group
  * g - group = can be people in the same project
  * o - other = everyone on the system 


> File or Directory permission can be displayed by running ls -l command
 
 > - rwx rwx rwx  
  in the above line the [-] refers has the file and first rwx is for the file, group and others 

> Command to change permission 
 chmod [change mod]

 syntax : chmod [g,u,o, a] [-+] [rwx] file_name

 chmod a-r file_name
 > here we are removing the read permission from all the users.
 
chmod u+w file_name
> here we are adding the write permissions to an file or an particular User

chmod g+rw file_name
> here we  are adding the read, write permission to an file for all the group members

Note point:

drwx : here I have an directory were it has
read, write , executable permissions , it has the executable permission
then only we cna go inside that directory 
I mean we can do : cd directory_name

drw- : here for this directory we do not have the executable permission
so we can not do this : cd directory_name.
