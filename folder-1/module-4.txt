Linux Command Syntax:
------------------------------ >

Commands typically have the syntax:
  > command options arguments


File and Directory Permissions ( chmod ) :
----------------------------------------------- >
> Permissions for an file or directory may be restricted to by types
> There are 3 types of the Permissions
  * r - read 
  * w - write 
  * x - execute = running a program

> Each permission (rwx) can be controlled at three levels
  * u - user = group
  * g - group = can be people in the same project
  * o - other = everyone on the system 


> File or Directory permission can be displayed by running ls -l command
 
 > - rwx rwx rwx  
  in the above line the [-] refers has the file and first rwx is for the file, group and others 

> Command to change permission 
 chmod [change mod]

 syntax : chmod [g,u,o, a] [-+] [rwx] file_name

 chmod a-r file_name
 > here we are removing the read permission from all the users.
 
chmod u+w file_name
> here we are adding the write permissions to an file or an particular User

chmod g+rw file_name
> here we  are adding the read, write permission to an file for all the group members

Note point:

drwx : here I have an directory were it has
read, write , executable permissions , it has the executable permission
then only we cna go inside that directory 
I mean we can do : cd directory_name

drw- : here for this directory we do not have the executable permission
so we can not do this : cd directory_name.


Permissions Using Numeric Mode:
------------------------------------- >

Permission to a file and directory can also be assigned numerically :
chmod ugo+r file_name
[or]
chmod 444 file_name




| Permission    | Symbol | Numeric Value | Meaning                                      |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Read          | `r`    | 4         | View file contents / list directory          |
| Write         | `w`    | 2         | Modify file / create-delete inside directory |
| Execute       | `x`    | 1         | Run file as program / enter directory        |
| No Permission | `-`    | 0         | No access                                    |




| Permission Combination | Calculation | Numeric Value | Symbol |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------ |
| Read only              | 4           | 4             | r--    |
| Write only             | 2           | 2             | -w-    |
| Execute only           | 1           | 1             | --x    |
| Read + Write           | 4 + 2       | 6             | rw-    |
| Read + Execute         | 4 + 1       | 5             | r-x    |
| Write + Execute        | 2 + 1       | 3             | -wx    |
| Read + Write + Execute | 4 + 2 + 1   | 7             | rwx    |


> chmod 746 file_name
here in this case, 7 rwx permissions to the user 
                   6 rw permissions to the group
                   4 r  permissions to the others 
                

File ownerShip :
-------------------- >
* There are 2 owners of a file or directory 
  > User and group
*  Command to change file ownerShip
  > chown and chgrp
     . chown changes the ownership of a file
     . chgrp changes the group ownership of a file

* Recursive ownership change option (Casecade):
   -R 
* 
Note: Only the root user can change the ownerShip of the file.
syntax: chown [permission_to_change] file_name

chown root file_name
> here we are changing the user permissions to the root 
chgrp root file_name
> here we are changing the group permission to the root.



Access Control List in Linux:
--------------------------------- >
> Access control List (ACL) provides an additional, more flexible permissions mechanism for files systems.It is designed to assist with UNIX file permissions. ACL allows you to give permissions for any user or group to any disc resource.

> ACLs allow you to give extra, fine-grained permissions to specific users or groups without changing the standard owner/group/others permissions.

Scenario Problem:
--------------------- >
What if you want to give only one specific user write access, but that user is NOT the owner and NOT in the group?

. Standard chmod cannot do that.
. This is where ACLs are used.

> commands to assign and remove the ACL permissions are:
   setfacl  and getfacl

To add permissions for user :
> setfacl -m u:user_name:rwx  /path/to/file

To add permission for the group :
> setfacl -m g:group_name:rw /path/to/file


> To get more info about the file use this command:
  [ getfacl file_name ]




Help Commands:
--------------------- >
> There are the 3 types of the help commands:

> whatis command_name
..> This command will get us more info about the command.

> command_name --Help
..> This command will get us more details/description about the command.

> man command
..> This command will get more info about the command.


TAB Completion and Up Arrow
------------------------------- >
> Hitting TAB key completes the available commands,files or directories.
   .> chm TAB
   .> ls j<TAB>
   .> cd Des<TAB>
> Hitting up arrow key on the keyboard returns the last command ran.

Adding Text to files ( Redirects) :-
-------------------------------------------- > 
1) echo "matter to add in to the file" > nameOfTheFile

Note Point:- To add new content to the existing file, without Overriding we need to use,
echo "This is new line we are adding to file" >> nameOfTheFile

2) cat > file.Text
Added the content..
CTRL+D

cat >> file.txt
Then type content → press CTRL + D.

3) Using the vi/vim
Press i → Insert mode
Add content
Press ESC
Type: { :wq }
Then press Enter (save & quit)

copying Content From one file to anotherFile
> cat file1.txt > file2.txt { withOut writing }
> cat file1.txt >> file2.txt { OverWrite }

File Maintenance Commands :
------------------------------------ >

# COPYING AN FILE :
cp: This is used to copy an files
syntax :
    cp source_File destination_File
    cp source_File /other/Location/path
# REMOVING AN FILE:
rm : This is used to remove an files.
syntax :
     rm file_name

# RENAME or MOVE
mv : This is used to rename an file [ OR ]
..> This is used to move an file to the location also

ex: Move a File to Another Location
mv file.txt /home/user/documents/
> This moves the file1.txt from the current directory to /home/user/documents/.

>> Rename a File:
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
> This will renames oldname.txt to newname.txt

>> Moves a directory:
mv myFolder /home/user/Desktop/

# REMOVE:
rm fileName : This will delete the file.

rm -f fileName.txt : This will delete the file withOut asking.

rm -r myFolder : This will deletes the directory, files,, Subdirectories.

rm -Rf myFolder : This will delete all, withOut any conformation.


File Display Commands :
------------------------------ >
> cat : To see the all content's of an file we use this.
> more :  more file_name
    NOTE : This will show only few contents of an file we can Use Space_key to move forward. q to get back Prompt back
> less : less messages
    NOTE : same has more/
    to get only 1 line down : j
    to get only 1 line move : k
> head : To see starting few lines we use this.
    NOTE: head -2 fileName: To see only the first 2 lines from the file.
> tail : To see bottom few lines we use this.
    NOTE: tail -2 fileName: To see only the last 2 lines from the file.


Filters/Text Processors Commands:
---------------------------------------- >
cut 
awk 
grep 
egrep 
sort 
uniq 
wc  : WordCount > This will gives us how many words are there in the file.
