# What is a Hypervisor ? :
------------------------------ >

A hypervisor is a software layer that:

    Creates virtual machines (VMs)
    Shares real hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network)
    Keeps each VM isolated from others


We have the two types of the Hypervisors:
TypeOne-1:
..> Runs directly on hardware (no host OS).
..> 

Type-2 Hypervisor (Hosted)
Runs on top of a host OS like a normal application.
ex: VirtualBox is a Type-2 hypervisor.


Hardware
   ↓
Host OS (Windows / Linux / macOS)
   ↓
VirtualBox (Hypervisor)
   ↓
Guest OS (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)


Hypervisor :
Software that enables multiple operating systems to share and run on the same physical hardware.

VirtualBox :
A Type-2 hypervisor that runs on a host operating system to create and manage virtual machines.


# what is the virtual box:
-------------------------------- >

..> Virtual box, is a free and open-source hypervisor for x86 computers currently.
..> VirtualBox lets you run another operating system (like Linux or Windows) as an app on your current system.
..> it’s a virtual machine manager.
You can:
Use Linux inside Windows
Use Windows inside Linux
Run multiple OSs at the same time


Linux, windows, MAC

# ways to install the OS:
----------------------------- >
...> 1️⃣ Using a CD / DVD (Traditional method):
How it works
OS files are stored on a CD/DVD
Computer boots from CD/DVD
Installer loads into memory
OS is installed on hard disk
..> 2️⃣ Using a USB Flash Drive (Bootable USB):
How it works
ISO image is written to a USB
BIOS/UEFI boots from USB
Installer runs
..> 3️⃣ Using an ISO Image (Virtual Machines)
How it works
ISO = digital copy of OS DVD
Hypervisor mounts ISO as a virtual C
VM boots from ISO
