# What is a Hypervisor ? :
------------------------------ >

A hypervisor is a software layer that:

    Creates virtual machines (VMs)
    Shares real hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network)
    Keeps each VM isolated from others


We have the two types of the Hypervisors:
TypeOne-1:
..> Runs directly on hardware (no host OS).
..> 

Type-2 Hypervisor (Hosted)
Runs on top of a host OS like a normal application.
ex: VirtualBox is a Type-2 hypervisor.
